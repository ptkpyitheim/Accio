### Note to Major League Hacking (MLH) mentor viewing this
* For easy viewing of codes and files I contributed, I put my initials beside the name of the folders and files. <em>Example: App(PTK).js</em>
* In each of those files you will see code blocks enclosed with comments with my initials. This indicates the pieces of codes I wrote.
* This branch <em>(my-contributions-comments)</em> may not run locally due to some file names being replaced by appending my initials. To run locally, please either use <em>master</em> or <em>end-of-semester-version</em> branches. Instructions are given there.
* The implementations for this branch of the app are identical to <em>end-of-semester-version</em> branch.

## Summary of Accio

### Pitch
> Our app seeks to address the never ending need to find community. Even without quarantine, there is a global epidemic of people feeling isolated from one another. Where are you supposed to go to find YOUR people? Which bar, which park, which record store are you supposed to go to? Instead of you hopping cafe to cafe hoping that youâ€™ll run into someone with your eclectic taste in coffee, our app brings them to you. Our app lets you join groups of people with similar interests and find where they are in the moment. Unlike other event and group based apps, Accio thrives in the <strong>right now</strong>. Any app can tell you what is going on next Friday, or what event you missed yesterday, but only Accio will tell you which friends want to do something <strong>right now</strong>. - <em>credits to Casey Mason</em>

    ```
    cd Accio/frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    - Expo should be launched on your favorite browser
    - Run the app on the simulator or scan the QR code after downloading [Expo Client](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) App.
  - Backend
    - Note: You do not need to run the backend code since the backend server is live.
    - If you wish to run the backend, follow the instructions below:
    ```
    cd Accio/backend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    - [Download and install MongoDB Community](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
    ```
    cd Downloads #or direct yourself to where the tar file was downloaded

    #Move the file to your home directory
    mv mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.0.7.tgz ~/ 

    cd ~/

    #Extract the file
    tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.0.7.tgz 

    #Change the name so it's more readable
    mv mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.0.7 mongodb 

    #Create two directories in your root directory. May have to run with sudo.
    mkdir -p /data/db 

    #Change persmissions
    sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db  

    #Start the server
    ~/mongodb/bin/mongod 
    ```
    - Make sure to change the baseURL in Constants.js file from the frontend to your public IP serving on port 8080.
